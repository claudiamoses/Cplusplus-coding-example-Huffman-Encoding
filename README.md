# Huffman-Encoding
This is an assignment I had for my CS 106B class at Stanford in spring, 2023. In this code, I create a Huffman Encoding Tree using a variety of techniques learned in the class including pointers, allocation and deallocation of memory, and recursion. At the bottom of the file, I write several STUDENT_TEST functions to test my code.
